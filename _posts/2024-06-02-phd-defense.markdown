I just passed my Ph.D. defense last Friday and it had all that I could wish for. After presenting my work to the public, the committee got to pick me in detail about the chapters for about an hour. Everyone survived, including the audience, and we regrouped on the USYS terrace for an apero. The weather was with us, there was carefully designed Ph.D hat with all sorts of jokes on my existence and we even got offered a spontaneous concert of Swiss brass music. Now unto new things!
