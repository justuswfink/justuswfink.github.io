This week I will rejoin my PhD group who has since moved from ETH Zurich to Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The [Quantitative Evolutionary Microbiology lab](https://qevomicrolab.org/) is housed in the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, and safely surrounded on all sides by science on the Busch campus. Looking forward to the next months and finishing up the work from the PhD!.
