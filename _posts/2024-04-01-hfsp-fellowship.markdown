Big news from last week!  I was acccepted as one of the 2024 fellows of the Human Frontier Science Program, almost 10 months after the application process got started. This is a 3-year post-doctoral fellowship for basic research in biology and I will carry out my research in the lab of Victoria Orphan at the California Institute of Technology, starting this summer.
