I just returned from a longer trip, that started with a visit to  the Gore Lab @ MIT in Boston where I got to give a talk at the Physicis of Living Systems Seminar on estimating fitness in bulk competition experiments, followed by the APS March Meeting in Minneapolis, a well-packed meeting with sessions on microbial communities, cell growth and evolutionary dynamics (where I got to present the more philosphical aspects).
