The cycle of resources on earth rests on the chemical activity of single-celled microorganisms, called microbes.
<!-- their specialized metabolic abilities, often organized into so-called microbial consortia in a close physical grid. --> 
Organized into microbial communities, they carry out the reactions that turn our waste back into basic building blocks.
<!-- In the small volume of their cell, microbes are able to concentrate chemical substrates with highly specialized enzymes and carry out the reactions that turn all forms of waste back into basic building blocks. -->
I am particularly interested in the microbial breakdown of pollutants and complex organic molecules, and the goal of my research is to understand where and when microbial populations are most likely to evolve the ability to consume these compounds.
To this end, I am looking into the transport of enzymes and substrates across the membrane, the arrival of new genes via  horizontal gene transfer and the selection pressures acting in low resource environments. 

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow with [Victoria Orphan](https://orphanlab.com) at the California Institute of Technology. Previously, I completed a PhD with [Michael Manhart](https://qevomicrolab.org/) at ETH Zurich  and I hold a master in mathematics from the University of Bonn.
