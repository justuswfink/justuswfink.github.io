The cycle of resources on earth rests on the chemical activity of single-celled microorganisms, called microbes.
<!-- their specialized metabolic abilities, often organized into so-called microbial consortia in a close physical grid. --> 
By concentrating the reactants and enzymes inside their cell walls, microbes carry are able to carry out reactions that are otherwise unheard of but the concentration comes at a cost: active energy is required to maintain a functional cytoplasm and the chemical gradient across the membrane. 
I am particularly interested in how microbes in marine sediment deal with these challenges, particularly when microbes have only little energy available to them as in the anaerobic oxidization of methane. 
To this end I am looking into the physiological response to energy starvation, the minimum energy rates to maintain chemical gradients  and the evolved strategies of microbes to maintain basic cell organization in bad times.
<!-- Organized into microbial communities, they carry out the reactions that turn our waste back into basic building blocks. -->
<!-- In the small volume of their cell, microbes are able to concentrate chemical substrates with highly specialized enzymes and carry out the reactions that turn all forms of waste back into basic building blocks. -->
<!-- I am particularly interested in the microbial breakdown of pollutants and complex organic molecules, and the goal of my research is to understand where and when microbial populations are most likely to evolve the ability to consume these compounds. -->
<!-- To this end, I am looking into the transport of enzymes and substrates across the membrane, the arrival of new genes via  horizontal gene transfer and the selection pressures acting in low resource environments. --> 

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow with [Victoria Orphan](https://orphanlab.caltech.edu/) at the California Institute of Technology. Previously, I completed a PhD with [Michael Manhart](https://qevomicrolab.org/) at ETH Zurich  and I hold a master in mathematics from the University of Bonn.
