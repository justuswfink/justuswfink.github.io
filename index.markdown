<!-- Single-celled microbial organisms, and the communities that they form in natural environments,  help to catalyze important chemical reactions. -->
<!-- I am fascinated by the metabolic capacities of microbes and how they develop new ones through the process of evolution. --> 

<!-- Multi-species microbial consortia are important players in the natural cycle of elements and their chemical output emerges from the specialized metabolism of consortia members in a close physical grid. -->
The cycle of resources on planet Earth rests on the chemical activity of single-celled microorganisms, called microbes.
<!-- their specialized metabolic abilities, often organized into so-called microbial consortia in a close physical grid. --> 
Often organized into metabolic consortia in a close physical grid, they carry out the reactions that turn all forms of waste back into basic building blocks.
<!-- In the small volume of their cell, microbes are able to concentrate chemical substrates with highly specialized enzymes and carry out the reactions that turn all forms of waste back into basic building blocks. -->
I am particularly interested in the microbial breakdown of pollutants and complex organic molecules, and the goal of my research is to understand where and when microbial populations are most likely to evolve the ability to consume these compounds.
To this end, I am looking into the transport of enzymes and substrates across the membrane, the arrival of new genes via  horizontal gene transfer and the selection pressures acting on microbial cells in their natural habitat in the form of nutrient limitation.

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow with Michael Manhart at the Quantitative Evolutionary Microbiology lab at Rutgers University. Previously, I have worked on the evolution of microbial growth rate during my Ph.D. at ETH Zurich and the convergence of stochastic partial differential equations during my masters at the University of Bonn. You can find out more about my personal trajectory here and about my publications on Google Scholar.
