Hi there, my name is Justus and I am a HFSP Long-Term Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Victoria Orphan](https://orphanlab.com). 
I am fascinated by the metabolic capacities of microbes, their ability to evolve and the question how they will respond to human pollution and perturbation of nature. 
At the Orphan Lab, I study the evolution of anaerobic methane degradation using a combination of theory and experiments, focusing particularly on the role of nutrient limitation.
I am a mathematician by training and hold a PhD from ETH Zurich, where I studied the evolution of microbial growth at low nutrient concentrations under the supervision of Michael Manhart. 

<!-- previously and first came into contact with ecology through an undergraduate research internship, where I helped to derive equations that describe how a population of beavers moves along a river (the internship was in Canada).  It's during my master's thesis  that I discovered my interest for the evolutionary process, working out the conditions for mutant invasion under phenotypic heterogeneity. -->
<!-- <!-1- the convergence of stochastic partial differential equations -1-> --> 
<!-- <!-1- that working out the stochastic invasion of a mutant genotype into a wild-type population with phenotypic heterogeneity. -1-> --> 
<!-- For my PhD, I chose to  work on empirical variation of microbial growth traits in the group of  Michael Manhart, then a junior group hosted within the [Theoretical Biology group](https://tb.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich. -->
<!-- <!-1- to figure out the variation in lag time, growth rate and biomass yield that mutation supplies and how selection acts on these traits. -1-> --> 

<!-- In the second half of my PhD, I became increasingly interested in the impact of microbial communities on biogeochemical cycling and bioremidiation, thanks to collaborating with Noelle Held (now [at USC](https://proteoceanlab.github.io/about.html))  and lot's of time  spent with the [Microbial System Ecology group](https://mse.ethz.ch/) and the [UMIK department](https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/umik/) at Eawag. --> 
<!-- <!-1- whether these microbes will adapt fast enough to help re-balance the resource cycles. -1-> -->
