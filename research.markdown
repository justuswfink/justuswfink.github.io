# The evolution of microbial growth across environments


Many microbial organisms are able to grow with extremely low concentration of nutrients, many orders of magnitude below the concentrations used in laboratory experiments. In my Ph.D., I asked how this ability is distributed across microbial taxa and resources, and how microbial populations improve their growth at low concentrations (Monod half-saturation constant) over evolutionary time. 
<!-- The microbial adaptation to low nutrient environments has been difficult to test with experiments, in part because these experiments are technically challenging (low concentration growth over many generations) --> 
By simulating evolution experiments in different environments, I found that that microbial taxa evolve half-saturation concentration much below the environmental levels of the nutrient, and there is no simple relationshi between the organism's trait and the environment they evolved in. 

More broadly, I am interested in nutrient limitation and the selection pressure that microbial populations experience in natural environments. In particularly, I am interested in methods to  estimate taxon-specific death and growth rates from environmental samples and use a combination of stable isotope probing and bio-orthogonal analogues for my post-doctoral work.

# Quantification challenges in  microbial ecology and evolution

Few concepts are as central to microbial ecology as 'fitness' and 'interaction', but the actual quantification varies across research groups. 
<!-- This ambiguity means the same data can be analysed in different ways, but how exactly the different versions of 'fitness' are related, is unclear. -->
Confused by the ambiguity in these concepts as a Ph.D student, I developed a unified framework that rederives all common statistics of relative fitness from first principles and helps to delineate true relative fitness statistics from other cncepts, like absolute fitness or fitness proxies like the area-under-the-curve (AUC). 
Using empirical trait data, I was able to show that the choice of time-scale for quantifying relative fitness (per-generation vs. per-cycle) can give rise to different fitness rankings and that the initial abundance of the mutant library is a key parameter to ensure accurate fitness rankings in transposon-seq experiments. 

<!-- A similar ambiguity surrounds the measurement of interaction strength between two microbial taxa, which may be defined through an experimental test or from models of population dynamics. Density-dependent models of competition capture interaction in a static coefficient, but offer no avenue to describe how the environment modulates the strength of interaction. As an alternative, I defined an interaction index for consumer-resource models that sums the sign of interaction over multiple resources, links interaction strength to the extracellular resource concentration and emphasizes that interaction can switch sign over a growth cycle. -->

I am broadly interested in issues of quantification and establishing connections between concepts. As a collaborator on experimental projects, I have developed  a measure of interaction strength for consumer-resource networks that links interaction to nutrient limitation and programmed custom software pipelines to quantify growth traits from high-throughput growth curve datasets using a combination of smoothing and piece-wise linear regression.

# Pre-PhD: Mathematical modeling for spatially structured populations

As DAAD Rise undergraduate researcher  at the University of Ottawa, I helped to derive a novel model for the spread of ecosystem engineers under the supervision of Frithjof Lutscher. The fact that these organisms modify their environment means the speed of expansion leads to an interesting partial differential equation, that closely resembles the equation for melting ice (Stefan problem).

For my master's thesis at the University of Bonn with Anton Bovier, I studied the invasion of mutant cells into a population with phenotypic heterogeneity, using a spatially-structured version of the Lokta-Volterra equation. Building on previous results, I was able to propose sufficient conditions for the successful invasion of a mutant using an abstract eigenvalue theorem from functional analysis.
